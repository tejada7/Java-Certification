This repo contains a bunch of tricky and basic samples that helped me prepare to pass Java Certifications, it also contains interview coding challenges and generally everything needed to have a decent understanding of this amazing technology.

I still keep this repo updated by pushing questions that I got during my job interviews, codingame challenges, leetcode and pretty much all I consider to be remembered when applying good Java coding practices.
